CLARKE ERROR GRID ANALYSIS      ClarkeErrorGrid.py

Need Matplotlib Pyplot


The Clarke Error Grid shows the differences between a blood glucose predictive measurement and a reference measurement,
and it shows the clinical significance of the differences between these values.
The x-axis corresponds to the reference value and the y-axis corresponds to the prediction.
The diagonal line shows the prediction value is the exact same as the reference value.
This grid is split into five zones. Zone A is defined as clinical accuracy while
zones C, D, and E are considered clinical error.

Zone A: Clinically Accurate
    This zone holds the values that differ from the reference values no more than 20 percent
    or the values in the hypoglycemic range (<70 mg/dl).
    According to the literature, values in zone A are considered clinically accurate.
    These values would lead to clinically correct treatment decisions.

Zone B: Clinically Acceptable
    This zone holds values that differe more than 20 percent but would lead to
    benign or no treatment based on assumptions.

Zone C: Overcorrecting
    This zone leads to overcorrecting acceptable BG levels.

Zone D: Failure to Detect
    This zone leads to failure to detect and treat errors in BG levels.
    The actual BG levels are outside of the acceptable levels while the predictions
    lie within the acceptable range

Zone E: Erroneous treatment
    This zone leads to erroneous treatment because prediction values are opposite to
    actual BG levels, and treatment would be opposite to what is recommended.


SYNTAX:
        plot, zone = ClarkeErrorGrid.clarke_error_grid(ref_values, pred_values)

INPUT:
        ref_values          List of n reference values
        pred_values         List of n prediciton values

OUTPUT:
        plot                The Clarke Error Grid Plot returned by the function.
                            Use this with plot.show()
        zone                List of values in each zone.
                            0=A, 1=B, 2=C, 3=D, 4=E

EXAMPLE:
        from ClarkeErrorGrid import clarke_error_grid
        ...
        plot, zone = clarke_error_grid(ref_values, pred_values)
        plot.show()
